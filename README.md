This repository contains Python programs organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific concept. 
The goal is to enhance your computational thinking and coding skills. 
Below are the details of each section and the corresponding files:

File 1 (Arrays): You will be able to implement functions in C with the following features:
                 1. Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
                 2. Passing arrays to a function

File 2 (Basic constructs of C): You will be able to make use of the following basic features of C
                                1. Data type declarations
                                2. I/O statements
                                3. Operators and expressions
                                4. Conditional statements

File 3 (Functions): You will be able to apply computational thinking to devise solutions through modular programming.
                    You code C programs by defining the functions with appropriate parameters and return statements.   

File 4 (Looping Statements): You will be able to familiarize the following basic features of C
                             1. Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)    

File 5 (Recursion): You will be able to apply computational thinking to solve problems that can be solved by processing its own smaller instances using recursive functions.     

File 6 (String): You will be able to implement string operations in C with the following features:
                1. Using built-in and user-defined string functions
                2. Passing strings to a function

File 7 (Structures, Files, Pointers): You will be able to implement user defined datatypes in C with the following features: 
                                      1. Using structures 
                                      2. Passing structures to a function 
                                      3. Using pointers 
                                      4. Using Files
